  <p class="header">Medium Bio:</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://danielsan.dyne.org/" target="_blank">Daniel Hassan</a> (UK|GUY), Chief Network Officer / Co-founder with Robin Hood Services; London and Melbourne based community organiser and computer engineer, passionate about <a href="http://robinhoodcoop.org/" target="_blank">Robin Hood</a> as a new mode of organization enabled by P2P finance and ubiquitous computing. Has been active in autonomous co-operatives for over a decade, specifically in areas of economics (<a href="http://www.rootstock.org.uk/" target="_blank">Rootstock</a>, <a href="http://robinhoodcoop.org/" target="_blank">Robin Hood</a>), housing (<a href="http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/" target="_blank">Radical Routes</a>), food (Food not Bombs), migration (No Borders), labour (<a href="http://www.footprinters.co.uk/" target="_blank">Footprint Workers Coop</a>) and social centres around the UK and Australia. Robin Hood's innovations in P2P finance resonate strongly with Dan's research into new modes of organisation enabled by the emergence of network platforms, blockchain technologies and ubiquitous computing. His MSc thesis: 'Assembling data: An application for understanding and analysing the block chain beyond cryptocurrency' forms a key research component of Decentralized Citizen Engagement Technologies (<a href="http://dcentproject.eu/" target="_blank">D-CENT</a>), an EU funded Europe-wide project creating blockchain based privacy-aware tools and applications for economic empowerment.</p>
    <p>He is also a resident consultant with the <a href="https://www.dyne.org/" target="_blank">Dyne Think(&Do) Tank</a>, advising on digital currency experiments to foster direct democracy.</p>

  <p class="header">Longer Bio:</p>
  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://danielsan.dyne.org/" target="_blank">Daniel Hassan</a> (UK|GUY) is a community organiser and computer engineer. He has been active in autonomous co-operatives for over a decade, specifically in areas of economics (<a href="http://www.rootstock.org.uk/" target="_blank">Rootstock</a>, <a href="http://robinhoodcoop.org/" target="_blank">Robin Hood</a>), housing (<a href="http://www.radicalroutes.org.uk/" target="_blank">Radical Routes</a>), food (Food not Bombs), migration (No Borders), labour (<a href="http://www.footprinters.co.uk/" target="_blank">Footprint Workers Coop</a>) and social centres around the UK and Australia. He has a particular interest in how people collectively self-determine their own living and working conditions. He tweets as <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_mi_sun" target="_blank">@dan_mi_sun</a> </p>
    <p>Daniel is currently an engineer with <a href="http://robinhoodcoop.org/" target="_blank">Robin Hood Minor Asset Management Cooperative</a>, an activist hedge fund that uses financial technologies to democratise finance, expand financial inclusion and generate new economic spaces. Through analysis of big data, development of algorithms, and deployment of web-based technologies such as blockchains Robin Hood aims to compose new financial instruments that can help to redistribute common wealth among groups committed to political, economic and social change. In his collaboration with Robin Hood he recently co-founded the Member Market, a service built on blockchain allowing members of Robin Hood to trade shares, bringing liquidity and easy auditing to the co-operative system.</p>
    <p>Alongside Robin Hood Daniel is a collaborator in groups bringing together issues of big data, politics and privacy. His MSc thesis: 'Assembling data: An application for understanding and analysing the block chain beyond cryptocurrency' forms a key research component of <a href="http://dcentproject.eu/" target="_blank">D-CENT</a>, an EU funded Europe-wide project creating privacy-aware tools and applications for economic empowerment. Together with EU citizens and developers, the project aims to build a decentralised social networking platform for large-scale collaboration and decision-making.</p>
    <p>He is also a resident consultant with the <a href="https://www.dyne.org/" target="_blank">Dyne Think(&Do) Tank</a>, advising on digital currency experiments to foster direct democracy across Europe. As an open-source approach to decentralized complementary currency design, Dyne works with grassroots organisations experimenting with digital social currency. Through this work, Dyne shows how human decisions deeply influence the behaviour of algorithms and seeks to place anti-racist, anti-classist and anti-sexist values at the heart of algorithm production.</p>
